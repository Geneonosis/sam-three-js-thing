<p>The path to mainstream 3D was bumpy but steady.</p>
<ol>
  <li>1990s: VRML and Java applets experiment with interactive graphics.</li>
  <li>2000s: Flash/Stage3D offer higher fidelity but lock developers into plugins.</li>
  <li>2011: WebGL lands everywhere, giving direct GPU access from JavaScript.</li>
  <li>2013+: Three.js abstracts the rough edges and grows a massive ecosystem.</li>
  <li>Today: WebGPU promises modern graphics APIs, better tooling, and higher performance.</li>
</ol>
